This dataset is gathered from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,Government of India https://www.mohfw.gov.in/.

This project includes basic exploratory data analysis of Covid19 India data. This analysis is done based on the present data, and the data changes daily so the figures fluctuate daily. We can automate this job if we want i.e. it will generate graphs and figures for analysis daily. We can use job scheduling to automate this.
